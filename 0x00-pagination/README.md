## Pagination
- Pagination is a technique used in user interfaces, especially in web design, to break content into separate pages. Instead of displaying all the content on a single page, pagination divides it into smaller, more manageable sections. This is commonly employed for lists, tables, search results, and other types of content that could become lengthy.

- The main purpose of pagination is to enhance user experience by making content more accessible, reducing loading times, and allowing users to navigate through information more easily. Pagination typically involves the use of navigation controls, such as page numbers or "Next" and "Previous" buttons, to move between different sections of content.

- In web development, pagination is often implemented using server-side or client-side scripting languages. Server-side pagination involves querying a database for a specific range of records to display on a page. Client-side pagination, on the other hand, involves loading all the data initially and then manipulating it on the user's device without making additional server requests.
